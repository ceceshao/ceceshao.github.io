	<h1>Unit 2: Website Layout</h1>
	
	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p>I was definitely most inspired by <a href="http://heystudio.es/" target="_blank">Hey Studio</a>'s website and <a href="http://cargocollective.com/nickimayrhofer/Panasonic-Design-Museum" target="_blank">Panasonic's Design Museum</a>'s website.</p>

	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p>I really like the emphasis that both layouts place on the content and the vibrancy that the bright objects against the more neutral background (grey) tone offers. Both websites are great examples of ‘form follows function’ since the heystudio website uses a mural-type design to display the work it has done while the panasonic website uses a timeline-style design to depict its content. On a more random note, I really enjoyed the Panasonic splice page.</p>

	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>For both websites, there was not really a main focal point to focus on and there seemed to be a greater emphasis on letting the viewer get a preview of all the important content than on seeing the logo. Both websites already have very simple use of font and color for the navigation interfaces and even religate things like social media and contact information to the bottom.</p>

	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
 	<p>Below, you'll see the thumbnail layout sketches that I made in InDesign (since Omnigraffle refuses to work for me haha). These sketches will be for an online portfolio/resume site that I will be making. I'm not sure if it will be my final project, but regardless, it will be something good to have on hand moving forward. I'll describe how each of the sketches demonstrate all the different concepts—focal point, hierarchy, and balance—across each grid-based layouts.</p>

	<!--use img to render your thumbnail sketches & p to write out how each demonstrate the above-->
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Home Page</strong><br>
		<img src="images/homepage.png" alt="Thumbnail Sketch of Home Page">
			<p>For the home page to my online resume, I didn't really want it to be too busy so I made sure to have a skewed ratio of positive to negative space by making an image (probably of one of my projects) or a series of changing images as the focal point. To balance out this graphic heavy landing page, I made the title (my name) and the small description at the bottom really simple and relatively small. In terms of hierarchy, I want my content and my work to speak for itself since they're what's really important. The prominent navigational bar on the right side of the page also contributes to the balance of the page and appears on all of the other pages of the site to facilitate user flow throughout.</p></li>
		<li><strong>About Page</strong><br>
		<img src="images/aboutpage.png">
			<p>The About Page has slightly more content and is busier than the home page. I think the focal point for this page is the image on the upper left. After looking at that image, the viewer will read the text below (depicted as the white box), then to the three smaller images (which will be variations on the larger image above them) then to the image on the right which is nestled by the navigation bar. The positioning of the 1st image that viewer sees, combined with the fact that it is larger than the three images below it and unobstructed by the navigational bar, establishes a clear hierarchy for the content on the page. Ideally, for the image on the right, I would have something that interacts with the navigational bar in some kind of playful way.</p></li>
		<li><strong>Detail Page #1</strong><br>
		<img src="images/detailpage1.png">
			<p>There is more text on each of the detail pages because I want to give more background into the different projects that I've done. The way that I've laid out the positive and negative space on the page doesn't allow for a central focal point—the image in the lower left is larger than the others but the viewer's eye should bounce up and down when it tries to determine what text is relevant to what image. I could also incorporate split previews of a series of images that would unfold as the viewer hovers over them in any of the image slots to fit in more content. For the future, I might even include a little image or tab that shows a preview of the next detail page to facilitate flow.</p></li>
		<li><strong>Detail Page #2</strong><br>
		<a href="www.google.com" target="_blank"><img src="images/detailpage2.png"></a>
			<p>This page is only slightly different from Detail Page #1 since I wanted to provide both continuity throughout all the detail pages and also wake the viewer up a bit by incorporating a slight change. I carry over the hierarchy through size of the images on the page as well as the clear divisions between the images and their corresponding text.</p>
			<p>Another option I could incorporate for all of the Detail pages for the site is to just have the images be visible and have text with a transparent background come up as the viewer's cursor hovers over the image.</p></li>
